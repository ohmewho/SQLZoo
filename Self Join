Q09 Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, including 'Craiglockhart' itself, 
offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.

Ans:

SELECT stopa.name, a.company, a.num
FROM route a left JOIN route b ON
  (a.company = b.company and a.num = b.num)
    JOIN stops stopa ON a.stop = stopa.id
    JOIN stops stopb ON b.stop = stopb.id
WHERE stopb.name = 'Craiglockhart'
ORDER BY a.num, a.pos


Q10 Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer,
and the bus no. and company for the second bus.

Hint
Self-join twice to find buses that visit Craiglockhart and Lochend, then join those on matching stops.

Ans version 1 from StackOverflow:

SELECT DISTINCT S.num, S.company, stops.name, E.num, E.company
FROM
(SELECT a.company, a.num, a.pos, b.stop
 FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
 WHERE a.stop=(SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name= 'Craiglockhart')
)S
  JOIN
(SELECT a.company, a.num, a.pos, b.stop
 FROM route a JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
 WHERE a.stop=(SELECT id FROM stops WHERE name= 'Lochend')
)E
ON (S.stop = E.stop)
JOIN stops ON(stops.id = S.stop)
order by S.num, stops.name, E.num

Ans version 2 of mine:

SELECT r1.num, r1.company, transfer1.name, r4.num, r4.company
  FROM stops start JOIN route r1 ON start.id = r1.stop
    JOIN route r2 ON r1.num = r2.num AND r1.company = r2.company
    JOIN stops transfer1 ON transfer1.id = r2.stop
    JOIN route r3 ON r3.stop = transfer1.id
    JOIN stops transfer2 ON transfer2.id = r3.stop
    JOIN route r4 on r4.company = r3.company AND r4.num = r3.num
    JOIN stops terminal ON terminal.id = r4.stop
WHERE start.name = 'Craiglockhart' AND terminal.name = 'Lochend'
ORDER BY r1.num, transfer1.name, r4.num


Ans version 3 of mine:

select clh.num, clh.company, transfer.name, lcd.num, lcd.company
from
(select 1stroute.num, 1stroute.company, 2ndroute.stop
from route 1stroute join route 2ndroute on 1stroute.num = 2ndroute.num and 1stroute.company = 2ndroute.company
join stops start on start.id = 1stroute.stop
where start.name = 'Craiglockhart') clh

join (select 1stroute.num, 1stroute.company, 2ndroute.stop
from route 1stroute join route 2ndroute on 1stroute.num = 2ndroute.num and 1stroute.company = 2ndroute.company
join stops start on start.id = 1stroute.stop
where start.name = 'Lochend') lcd

on clh.stop = lcd.stop
join stops transfer on transfer.id = clh.stop
order by clh.num, transfer.name, lcd.num
